This game features a beautiful game scene, two man: a Ninja and Romans soldier, fighting until one of them is dead. What's more, the tints (i.e. hurt tint) and actions are beyond description.

My two teammates and I came up with the game set together, for example, what's a fighting game be like, what are essential functions or elements in the game. Then, we had spending total a week collaborating to make this happened.

There's no part that I am completely responsible, but I had helped other teammate debug, fixed fundamental problems, and finished almost 95% of "character.c" file. "character.c" file may be the most important and difficult file in this game, and the lines of code is the biggest, too.
